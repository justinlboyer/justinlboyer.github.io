additionalinfo: |
   <strong>R, Matlab</strong>: I am experienced in R and Matlab. Prior to using R and Matlab to build models, I tutored students learning these languages for 4 years. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Data Analysis</strong>: My Data Analysis experience stems from coursework in probability and statistics further supplemented by MOOC's in statistics and machine learning.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Numerical Analysis</strong>: I have completed year long coursework in numerical analysis.  In this course we analysised many numerical methods, such as Regression, Finite Element, and Fast Fourier Transform.<br/><br/>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Java, Android, Google Analytics, and Teaching Methodoligies.
